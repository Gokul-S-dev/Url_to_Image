## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Server**: Express.js server running on port 3000
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /download` - handles image download requests
- **Dependencies**:
  - `express`: Web framework
  - `axios`: HTTP client for downloading images
  - `path`: File path utilities
  - `fs`: File system operations

### Frontend (HTML + CSS)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Modern Styling**: CSS gradients and animations
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Cross-browser Compatible**: Works on all modern browsers

### Key Features
- **Stream Processing**: Images are downloaded as streams for memory efficiency
- **Unique Filenames**: Timestamp-based naming prevents file conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues
- **Static File Serving**: Express serves the frontend from the public directory

## 🚨 Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:
- **Invalid URLs**: Returns appropriate error messages
- **Network Issues**: Handles connection timeouts and failures
- **File System Errors**: Manages disk space and permission issues
- **Invalid Image URLs**: Gracefully handles non-image URLs

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Input validation for URLs
- File type restrictions (images only)
- Safe file naming to prevent path traversal
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## 🛠️ Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```

### Adding New Features
1. Modify `server.js` for backend changes
2. Update `public/index.html` for frontend changes
3. Add new dependencies to `package.json` if needed
